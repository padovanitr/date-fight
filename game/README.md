Build a turn-based board game in JavaScript

Technologies: Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3.

Requirements:
1. Randomly generating the game map with obstacles, players, weapons and available space to move.
2. For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn. 
3. If a player passes over a box containing a weapon, they leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the new one.
4. If players cross over adjacent squares, a battle begins.
